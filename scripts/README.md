# JSON-LD to Markdown Generator

This Python script processes [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/) files representing software tools and generates corresponding Markdown files for TechRadar dashboard. It is designed to support technology radar-style documentation by extracting metadata like tool name, category, tags, and description.

## Directory Structure
```
project/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ software-tools/ # Place your .json files here
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ radar/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ YYYY-MM-DD/ # Markdown files will be generated here

â”œâ”€â”€ generate_techradar_markdowns.py # The main script
â””â”€â”€ README.md # You're here!
```

## ðŸ§° Features

- Extracts fields from JSON-LD files such as:
  - `name`
  - `applicationCategory`
  - `hasQualityDimension`
  - `howToUse`
  - `license`
  - `url`
  - `description`
  - `appliesToProgrammingLanguage`
- Generates markdown files for each tool, organizing them by quality dimensions and application categories.
- Supports multi-dimensional tools and generates a separate markdown file for each quality dimension when necessary.
- Automatically adds tags such as "multi-dimensional" for tools with more than one quality dimension.
- Stores the output in a timestamped folder under `radar/`.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

This script uses only the Python standard library, so no external packages are required.

Make sure you have Python 3.7 or later installed:

```bash
python3 --version
```

### 2. Prepare Input

Place your .json files inside the data/software-tools/ directory. Each file should follow the JSON-LD format with relevant metadata.


### 3. Run the Script Locally

You can run the script from the terminal:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 generate_markdown.py
```

### 4. Output Format (Markdown)
Each generated file will contain:
```
---
title: "Tool Name"
ring: AnalysisCode/ResearchInfrastructureSoftware/PrototypeTool
segment: Quality dimension
tags: [QualityTag, UsageMethod, LicenseType, Programming language]
---
https://example.com
Tool description here.

```
### 5. Open a Pull Request to Add New Markdown Files

Once a new folder containing the markdown files is generated, open a pull request (PR) to merge this addition into the main branch. This PR will be part of preparing a new release of the TechRadar.
