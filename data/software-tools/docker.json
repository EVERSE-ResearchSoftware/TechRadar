  "description": "Containerization platform that packages applications with their dependencies into portable containers. Enhances **Compatibility** by enabling co-existence of multiple software versions and providing interoperability across different operating systems and cloud platforms. Improves **Flexibility** through high adaptability to different deployment environments, horizontal scalability via container orchestration, simplified installability with consistent deployment processes, and easy replaceability of containerized components. Strengthens **Reliability** by providing fault tolerance through container isolation, improved availability via quick container restarts and health checks, and enhanced recoverability with immutable container images and rollback capabilities. Supports **Sustainability** by ensuring software remains functional across new platforms through containerization, meeting evolving deployment needs, and maintaining long-term accessibility of research software environments.",
