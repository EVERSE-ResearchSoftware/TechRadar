  "description": "Tool for reproducible builds and declarative system configuration using the Nix language. Improves **Flexibility** by enabling multiple software versions and environments to coexist without conflicts, allowing researchers to switch between different tool configurations. Enhances **Reliability** through immutable package management and atomic upgrades/rollbacks, ensuring consistent and reproducible software environments across different systems. Strengthens **Security** via isolated build environments, cryptographic verification of packages, and the ability to quickly patch vulnerabilities through declarative configuration updates.",
