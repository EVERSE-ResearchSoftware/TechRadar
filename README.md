# EVERSE TechRadar

This is preliminary work done as part of [EVERSE project][everse-url] Technology Watch.

It contains a [catalog of _tools and services for research software quality_](#research-quality-tools-and-services-catalog) designed to assess, measure, and improve the quality of software developed for research purposes and the [TechRadar](#technology-radar-dashboard), a visual dashboard to display the catalog.

## Research Quality Tools and Services Catalog

The present catalog includes tools and services that incorporate features that address the unique requirements of research software, including but not limited to:

- Analysis of source code to identify potential issues, vulnerabilities, and adherence to coding standards specific to research contexts.

- Evaluation of software against research-specific quality attributes such as reproducibility and FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability).

- Support for community standards and best practices relevant to specific research disciplines.

- Metrics and measurements tailored to assess both technical aspects and research-oriented factors.

- Capabilities to analyze and improve research software quality throughout the research software lifecycle, from development to long-term sustainability.  

These tools aim to enhance the overall quality, reliability, and reusability of research software, ultimately contributing to the reproducibility and impact of scientific research.

### Content & publication process

We welcome content contributions to the catalog (see our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) in the form of JSON files describing tools and services for research software quality.

After review from our curation team, the entry will be added to [our catalog](data/software-tools) as JSON file.

New versions of the TechRadar will be published regularly. You can find all the releases at the [releases](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/TechRadar/releases) page.

## EVERSE TechRadar dashboard

The catalog of tools and services is presented in a visual dashboard at <https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/TechRadar>.


### Development
Make sure you install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) on your system as it will be needed to build and serve TechRadar.
> [!WARNING]
> The work is initial representation and is likely to be changed.
> The current version of Technology Watch is a work in progress.
> Any content should not be considered final at this stage.

#### Build the TechRadar

```bash
npm install
npm run serve
```

Then open here: <http://localhost:3000/techradar>

#### Build with static files

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

#### Run lint and formatting check on tools -> /data/software-tools/*.json

```bash
npm install
npm run lint-prettier:check
```

#### Run lint and formatting fix

```bash
npm install
npm run lint-prettier:fix
```
