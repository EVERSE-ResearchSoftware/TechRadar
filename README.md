# EVERSE TechRadar

This is preliminary work done as part of [EVERSE project](https://everse.software/) Technology Watch. It contains a collection of _tools and services for research software quality_ designed to assess, measure, and improve the quality of software developed for research purposes. These tools incorporate features that address the unique requirements of research software, including (but not limited to):

- Analysis of source code to identify potential issues, vulnerabilities, and adherence to coding standards specific to research contexts.

- Evaluation of software against research-specific quality attributes such as reproducibility and FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability).

- Support for community standards and best practices relevant to specific research disciplines.

- Metrics and measurements tailored to assess both technical aspects and research-oriented factors.

- Capabilities to analyze and improve software quality throughout the research software lifecycle, from development to long-term sustainability.


These tools aim to enhance the overall quality, reliability, and reusability of research software, ultimately contributing to the reproducibility and impact of scientific research.

The catalog of tools and services is presented in a visual dashboard at https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/TechRadar.
