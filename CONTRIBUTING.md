## Quick Start: Add or update a tool

The TechRadar catalogue lives under `data/software-tools/` as one JSON file per tool using the RS metadata schema.

<details>
   <summary><strong>New tool — step-by-step</strong></summary>

1) **Fork** this repository and **create a branch** for your change.
2) **Create a JSON file** in `data/software-tools/` (use an existing file as a template) and follow the [RS metadata schema](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/schemas/tree/main/software).
3) **Fill metadata carefully:** name, description (what it improves and for whom), URLs (homepage, repo, docs), quality dimensions, license, and how to use.
4) (Optional) **Preview locally** to sanity-check: run a build and open the generated site.
5) **Commit & push**, then **open a Pull Request** explaining the rationale and context.
6) **Request review** from @EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/techradar-curators and address feedback.

</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>Update existing tool — step-by-step</strong></summary>

1) **Find the JSON** in `data/software-tools/` and make a new branch.
2) **Edit fields** you want to improve (e.g., description, links, quality dimensions, tags).
3) (Optional) **Preview locally** to verify formatting and links.
4) **Commit & push**, then **open a Pull Request** with a concise changelog of what changed and why.
5) **Respond to review** and iterate until approved.

## Inclusion criteria

All tools/services added to the TechRadar must satisfy these criteria:

1. Designed to measure and/or improve software quality (and demonstrably does so)
2. Frequently used on research software and actively maintained
3. Enables adherence to relevant research community standards and best practices
4. Has capabilities to analyse and improve software quality across the [research software lifecycle](https://everse.software/RSQKit/life_cycle#the-research-software-lifecycle) (from development to long-term sustainability)

## Authoring guide: JSON and metadata quality

Aim for clarity, completeness, and evidence. Prefer concise, user-focused descriptions.

- **name:** Use the official tool/service name; ensure the file name is unique and stable.
- **description:** State what the tool improves (e.g., maintainability, security), for whom, and how. Extra information is welcome but keep it focused.
- **url:** Link to the official homepage or repository.
- **hasQualityDimension:** Map capabilities to [EVERSE Quality Dimensions](https://everse.software/indicators/website/dimensions.html).
- **license:** Provide URL to the license file.
- **howToUse:** List the means to use the tool using the following terminology: `online-service`, `command-line`, `CI/CD`.
- **applicationCategory:** Specify the relevant research software tiers on which the tool operates: `rs:AnalysisCode`, `rs:PrototypeTool`, or `rs:ResearchInfrastructureSoftware`. For example, `AnalysisCode` means the tool is suitable to improve or assess the quality of software in that tier.

## Review process

1. Curators validate inclusion criteria and metadata quality and correctness
2. Reviewers may request clarifications or changes
3. Once approved, the change is merged and appears in the next published release
4. For time-sensitive updates, ping @EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/techradar-curators in the PR

<details>
   <summary><strong>Review tips for curators</strong></summary>

To help you decide on the Software Tier, please refer to https://zenodo.org/records/7248877 and use the low, medium and high levels. E.g. Version control concerns all tiers, while Risk analysis would be important to Research Infrastructure Software only.

</details>

## Local validation (optional)

Please refer to our README for instructions on how to build and preview the TechRadar site locally. This helps you verify that your changes render correctly and that all links are valid before submitting a Pull Request.

## Technical contribution

Our TechRadar is based on a fork of the [AOE technology radar](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/aoe_technology_radar).

For technical contributions, changes might need to be made to the underlying codebase in this repository. 
In doubt, open an issue in the [TechRadar issue tracker](https://github.com/EVERSE-ResearchSoftware/TechRadar/issues/new/choose) and we will transfer it to the AOE repository if appropriate.

## FAQ

<details>
   <summary><strong>My tool spans multiple quality dimensions. How should I choose?</strong></summary>
You can list multiple quality dimensions in the `hasQualityDimension` field. Ensure each dimension is justified based on the tool's capabilities.
</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>Can I add a tool that is not actively maintained?</strong></summary>
Generally no. Exceptions require strong evidence of ongoing community use and clear value for research software quality.
</details>

<details>
   <summary><strong>How do I reference publications?</strong></summary>
