# How to use the EVERSE Technology Watch

### Introduction

Technology Watch(TW), developed as part of EVERSE project, is preliminary work done referencing AOE tech radar. It contains collection of research software quality tools and their metadata in terms of quality indicators and quality dimentions. It contains all the tools for research software quality that align, adapt, and extend to the specific needs of various research communities.


### What is the EVERSE Technology Watch?

The Technology Watch provides an overview of different technologies, including languages, frameworks,
tools, and patterns, as well as platforms, that EVERSE collected from the workshops. The watch does not
cover all established technologies; instead, it focuses on tools that have recently gained
significance and used for scientific cluster use cases.

### How it is created

The tools in the technology watch are from EVERSE work package 3 collected tools sheet. 


#### [WIP] The quadrants are:

- **Source Code Management:** This quadrant includes Source code management (SCM) tools related software development, using this developers can track and manage changes to software code over time..
- **FAIRness:** This quadrant covers Tools and services to help with software FAIRness evalution and improvement..
- **Platforms and Services:** This quadrant clusters technologies focused on the operation of software, related platforms, tools, infrastructure, and services.
- **Documentation:** In this quadrant, we group technologies which help to create, build and integrate good documentation of the software..

#### Each of the items is classified in one of these rings:

- **analysis code:** We wholeheartedly recommend this technology. It has been extensively used in many teams
  for an extended period, proving its stability and utility.
- **prototype tools:** We have successfully implemented this technology and suggest taking a closer look at it
  in this category. The aim here is to scrutinize these items more closely with the intention of
  elevating them to the 'Adopt' level.
- **research infrastructure software:** We have experimented with this technology and find it promising. We recommend
  exploring these items when you encounter a specific need for the technology in your project.
