# How to use the EVERSE Technology Watch

### Introduction

Technology Watch(TW), developed as part of EVERSE project, is preliminary work done referencing AOE tech radar. It contains collection of research software quality tools and their metadata in terms of quality indicators and quality dimentions. It contains all the tools for research software quality that align, adapt, and extend to the specific needs of various research communities.


### What is the EVERSE Technology Watch?

This is preliminary work done as part of [EVERSE project](https://everse.software/) Technology Watch.
It contains a [catalog of of _tools and services for research software quality_](#research-quality-tools-and-services-catalog) designed to assess, measure, and improve the quality of software developed for research purposes and the [TechRadar](#technology-radar-dashboard), a visual dashboard to display the catalog. The EVERSE Technology Watch offers a comprehensive overview of various research software quality tools and services. These tools and services are systematically categorized and presented in alignment with the established quality dimensions as segments. It is important to note that the watch does not encompass all existing tools and services; rather, it concentrates on tools that satisfies a set of criteria.

### How it is created

WIP


#### The segments are:

- **Compatibility:** This segment covers tools and services that assess the degree to which a product, system, or component can exchange information with other products, systems, or components, and/or perform its required functions while sharing a common environment and resources.
- **FAIRness:** This segment covers tools and services that evaluate FAIRness, which refers to the extent to which research software aligns with the FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
- **Flexibility:** This segment covers tools and services that assess the degree to which a product can be adapted to changes in its requirements, contexts of use or system environment.
- **Functional Suitability:** This segment covers tools and services that assess the degree to which a product or system supports users in performing their tasks and achieving specified goals.
- **Interaction Capability:** This segment covers tools and services that assess the degree to which a product or system supports users in performing their tasks and achieving specified goals through effective interaction.
- **Maintainability:** This segment covers tools and services that evaluate the degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be modified to improve it, correct it, or adapt it to changes in environment and requirements.
- **Performance Efficiency:** This segment covers tools and services that measure the degree to which a product performs its functions within specified time and throughput parameters, while efficiently utilizing resources (such as CPU, memory, storage, network devices, energy, and materials) under defined conditions.
- **Reliability:** This segment covers tools and services that assess the degree to which a system, product, or component performs specified functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time.
- **Safety:** This segment covers tools and services that evaluate the degree to which a product, under defined conditions, avoids situations that could endanger human life, health, property, or the environment.
- **Security:** This segment covers tools and services that measure the degree to which a product or system defends against attack patterns by malicious actors, while protecting information and data to ensure that individuals or other systems have the appropriate level of access based on their types and authorization levels.
- **Sustainability:** This segment covers tools and services that assess the capacity of software to endure, ensuring its availability on future platforms and its ability to meet evolving needs over time.

#### Each of the items is classified in one of these rings:

- **analysis code:** 
- **prototype tools:** 
- **research infrastructure software:**
