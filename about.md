# EVERSE Technology Radar

## Introduction

The EVERSE Technology Radar is developed as part of the [EVERSE](https://everse.software/) project to collect and classify tools and services that can measure or improve Research Software Quality.


## What is the EVERSE Technology Radar?

It contains:
- a catalogue of tools and services for research software quality designed to assess, measure, and improve the quality of software developed for research purposes
- the TechRadar, a visual dashboard to display the catalogue 

The EVERSE Technology Radar offers a comprehensive overview of various research software quality tools and services. These tools and services are systematically categorised and presented in alignment with the established quality dimensions as segments. It is important to note that the radar does not encompass all existing tools and services; rather, it concentrates on tools that satisfy a set of criteria.

## How it is created

The tools and services appearing in the TechRadar can be proposed by anyone, but are reviewed by the TechRadar [curation team](#curation-team) before addition.
Please see [instructions below](#contributing-to-the-everse-technology-radar).


#### Segments

The radar segments map [the EVERSE Quality Dimensions](https://everse.software/indicators/website/dimensions.html).

- **Compatibility:** This segment covers tools and services that assess the degree to which a product, system, or component can exchange information with other products, systems, or components, and/or perform its required functions while sharing a common environment and resources.
- **FAIRness:** This segment covers tools and services that evaluate FAIRness, which refers to the extent to which research software aligns with the FAIR principles: Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.
- **Flexibility:** This segment covers tools and services that assess the degree to which a product can be adapted to changes in its requirements, contexts of use or system environment.
- **Functional Suitability:** This segment covers tools and services that assess the degree to which a product or system supports users in performing their tasks and achieving specified goals.
- **Interaction Capability:** This segment covers tools and services that assess the degree to which a product or system supports users in performing their tasks and achieving specified goals through effective interaction.
- **Maintainability:** This segment covers tools and services that evaluate the degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be modified to improve it, correct it, or adapt it to changes in environment and requirements.
- **Performance Efficiency:** This segment covers tools and services that measure the degree to which a product performs its functions within specified time and throughput parameters, while efficiently utilizing resources (such as CPU, memory, storage, network devices, energy, and materials) under defined conditions.
- **Reliability:** This segment covers tools and services that assess the degree to which a system, product, or component performs specified functions under specified conditions for a specified period of time.
- **Safety:** This segment covers tools and services that evaluate the degree to which a product, under defined conditions, avoids situations that could endanger human life, health, property, or the environment.
- **Security:** This segment covers tools and services that measure the degree to which a product or system defends against attack patterns by malicious actors, while protecting information and data to ensure that individuals or other systems have the appropriate level of access based on their types and authorization levels.
- **Sustainability:** This segment covers tools and services that assess the capacity of software to endure, ensuring its availability on future platforms and its ability to meet evolving needs over time.


#### Rings

The rings reflect the [three-tier model of research software](https://everse.software/RSQKit/three_tier_view):

* **Analysis Code**
* **Prototype Tools**
* **Research Infrastructure Software**

Not all research software needs to meet the same quality requirements — these depend on the software’s development tier.
Some quality tools and services are tailored to more advanced or mature tiers than others.

This ring-based categorization is designed to help you identify the tools and practices most relevant to your software’s tier and specific needs.

Note: if a tool is relevant to multiple tiers, it is placed only in the **lowest applicable tier** (i.e. the one closer to the radar core).


## Contributing to the EVERSE Technology Radar

The EVERSE Technology Radar is a community-driven initiative, and we welcome contributions from anyone interested in enhancing the catalogue of tools and services for research software quality.
If you would like to suggest a new tool or service to be added to the TechRadar, please follow the instructions in our [contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
